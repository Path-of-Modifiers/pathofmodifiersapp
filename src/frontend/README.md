# Path of Modifiers - Frontend

The frontend is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest), [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest) and [Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/).

## Frontend development

Before you begin, ensure that you have the Node Version Manager (nvm) installed on your system.

You can install it using the [official nvm guide](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

After installing nvm, proceed to the frontend directory:

`cd frontend`
