# Alembic migrations

This section describes how to migrate changes made in database models to the database postgres server. Migrations are done inside the `backend` container, which runs our API.

To enter the `backend` container, run:

```bash
docker container exec -it src-backend-1 bash
```

3. To migrate database changes, run:
