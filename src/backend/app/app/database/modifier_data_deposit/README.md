# How to deposit new data?
1. Ready file in csv-format
   - Add comments that are recorded in `history.log` by starting initial lines with `#`
2. Paste file into `./new_data`
3. Run `deposit_new_data.py`

## Without a permanent database
While still testing and developing, files need to be moved from `.\deposited_data` into `.\new_data` again.
